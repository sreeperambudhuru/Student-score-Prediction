# 📘 Student Score Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a simple Machine Learning project that predicts the marks scored by a student based on the number of hours they studied.

## 📊 Project Objective
To build a Linear Regression model to predict student scores using a single feature: **Hours Studied**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)

## 📁 Files Included
- `student_score_prediction.ipynb` — The notebook with code and results
- `student_score_prediction.pdf` — Exported project report

## 🧠 Key Learning
- Data preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Model training and evaluation using Linear Regression
- Making predictions

## 📈 Sample Output

The model predicted the score based on 9.25 hours of study as:
> **Predicted Score: 93.69**
